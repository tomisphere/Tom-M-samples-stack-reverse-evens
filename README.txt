To see these code samples, just open "Stack and Reversal and Evens.xlsm" in Microsoft Excel, then open any of the macros for editing from either the View menu or the Developer menu.

The clsStack class module implements the stack, with methods Push, Pop, and function StackIsEmpty.
These are used in the macros TestMyStack and TestMyStack2, both of which intentionally create error conditions, and TestMyStack3, which does not.  These macros are in the StackTests module.

The ReverseArray module contains the array reversal routine ReverseArray, and two macros that test it, TestReverseStringArray and TestReverseDoubleArray.

The PrintEvens module contains the PrintEvens macro which prints the even numbers from 0 to 100.
